In experiments, we could enforce its termination by tagging, a syntactic transformation of messages that leaves attack-free executions invariant. In this paper, we generalize the experimental evidence: we prove that the verification method always terminates for tagged protocols."

abstract="The termination insensitive secure information flow problem can be reduced to solving a safety problem via a simple program transformation. Barthe, D'Argenio, and Rezk coined the term ``self-composition'' to describe this reduction. This paper generalizes the self-compositional approach with a form of information downgrading recently proposed by Li and Zdancewic. We also identify a problem with applying the self-compositional approach in practice, and we present a solution to this problem that makes use of more traditional type-based approaches. The result is a framework that combines the best of both worlds, i.e., better than traditional type-based approaches and better than the self-compositional approach.",

abstract="We present a model checking technique for security protocols based on a reduction to propositional logic. At the core of our approach is a procedure that, given a description of the protocol in a multi-set rewriting formalism and a positive integer k, builds a propositional formula whose models (if any) correspond to attacks on the protocol. Thus, finding attacks on protocols boils down to checking a propositional formula for satisfiability, problem that is usually solved very efficiently by modern SAT solvers. Experimental results indicate that the approach scales up to industrial strength security protocols with performance comparable with (and in some cases superior to) that of other state-of-the-art protocol analysers.",

This verifier can prove secrecy, authentication, and observational equivalence properties of security protocols, for an unbounded number of sessions of the protocol. It supports a wide range of cryptographic primitives defined by rewrite rules or by equations. The tool takes as input a description of the protocol to verify in a process calculus, an extension of the pi calculus with cryptography. It automatically translates this protocol into an abstract representation of the protocol by Horn clauses, and determines whether the desired security properties hold by resolution on these clauses.",
